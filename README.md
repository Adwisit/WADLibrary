# WADLibrary

WADLibrary is a Application testing library for Robot Framework that utilizes [Win App Driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver).

This library was created to be able to work with multi window use cases compared to Appium.

To install WinAppDriver please follow the instructios over on their [github page](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver).

To install the package:
```
pip install robotframework-wadlibrary
```

This is my first python package so many things are not fixed yet, such as requirements. 

Looking for Keyword Documentation? There is none! (Yet) For now you'll have to simply look in the keyword file.

I've included a simple demo that shows how to use the main feature (compared to appium), i.e. switching between windows.
